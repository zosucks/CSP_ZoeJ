        <h1>Kitty cats!</h1>
        <h2>Why are they so interesting?</h2>
        <p>People say once a cat likes you they are your best friend for life. I know thats true as I have made many cat emenies as well as cat friends. They sure are cute and cuddlely but when you do them any sort of harm they will beat you up. If they are outdoor cats even scarier as they know how to fight and their claws aren't trimmmed.</p>

        <h2><br>Where to start YOUR kitty rabbit-hole!</h2>
        <p>One thing to look up is how their whiskers work! As they are an important part of a cat, have you ever seen a cat pick of food out of their bowl and spit it out on the floor? Well ladies and gentlemen your kitty needs a different bowl as they are getting <a href="https://www.petmd.com/general-health/whisker-fatigue-cats-what-it-and-how-help" target="_blank">whisker fatigue</a>.
