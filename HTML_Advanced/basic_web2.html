        <h1>"How's CSP going?"</h1>
        <h2>CSP 1030</h2>
    <p>A class that I never knew existed, so heres my thoughts on this class. Please keep in mind, I have never been a computer type of person. Whenever I handle computers in any form I feel like a grandma. Computers give me troubles so I give them trouble back by just yelling a lot. So I might have some bias as I'm not a fan.</p>

    <h3>Because I'm not a fan heres the units we learned in the order that I hated the most:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Programming</li>
        <li>Basics</li>
        <li>The internet</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Programming</h2>
    <p>The unit that I hated the most, beginning it wasn't too bad but the more and more we went into it, the more I dreaded it. Python was one of the languages that we learned as well as C. Which are two completely different coding languages. Both were just as hard though so there was so escape from harder languages.</p>
