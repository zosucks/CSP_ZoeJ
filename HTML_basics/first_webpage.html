        <h1>Say Yes to Music!</h1>
        <br><h2>Why is this?</h2>
        <p>Growing up I have always been around some sort of music. My family being Latinos have normalized that having slience is worse then music. So they would always put something on, like cleaning, faint music when we are eating, or in the car. Its odd to me when people and their families just sit in slience while driving somewhere. Meanwhile me and my mom and dancing at a spanish song that she would dance to at parties when she was my age. So when I began to listen my own music I would express how much I love a song while the other person looks at me with a blank stare, telling me that 'they dont listen to music' (monsters literally) at first I was 'okay? Well do you listen to anything else?' and they would respond with another blank stare saying that they dont listen to music to an entirety. HOW? All sorts of people like me because of the type of music I listen to, this is only because my brother would introduce me to so many genres. This is to the people out there... PLEASE LISTEN TO MUSIC, I swear it will impact your life. </p>
        <br><h2>Where do I start?!</h2>
        <p>First, breathe. Starting off with music is an adventure that you will always be on. Listening to different types of music at any chance you get will make you decide if you're a person that only likes one very speficic type of music and beats, a person that says 'If it sounds good then I put in my playlist', or a person that is open to any type of music as long as it's standable. Personally for me I am a person that is open to any type of music (expect country, sorry not sorry..) because of my background with so much music. I have a nice base of all types of music to listen to. I only started to listen to music on purpose when I was in 6th grade. As my friend had introduced me to a band called Arctic Monkeys, it was life changing, their beats and Alex Turner's lyrics were something that never stopped repeating in my head. Thats when I found out I enjoyed a more type of Rock/Indie type of music. As then afterwards I found other bands that I knew the lyrics of but never found out the actual artists. </p>
